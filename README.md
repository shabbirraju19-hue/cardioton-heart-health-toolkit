## What is Cardioton?

**Cardioton** is a premium Ayurvedic heart health supplement formulated with time-tested natural ingredients known for their cardiovascular benefits. Designed for individuals seeking natural support for healthy blood pressure levels, Cardioton combines traditional Indian medicinal wisdom with modern quality standards.

### The Cardiovascular Challenge

High blood pressure (hypertension) affects over **1.3 billion people worldwide**, with India bearing a significant burden of the disease. Often called the "silent killer," hypertension frequently presents no symptoms while damaging arteries, the heart, kidneys, and brain. Lifestyle factors including stress, poor diet, sedentary habits, and genetic predisposition contribute to rising BP levels across all age groups.

### How Cardioton Supports Heart Health

Cardioton ayurvedic medicine works through multiple mechanisms to support cardiovascular wellness:

**1. Blood Pressure Regulation**
The carefully selected herbs in Cardioton have been traditionally used to help maintain healthy blood pressure levels. Ingredients like Sarpagandha and Arjuna have documented hypotensive effects, helping to relax blood vessels and improve circulation.

**2. Cardiac Muscle Support**
Arjuna bark, a key ingredient in Cardioton, has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine as a cardiotonic. It helps strengthen the heart muscle, improving its pumping efficiency and overall cardiac function.

**3. Antioxidant Protection**
Modern lifestyles expose us to oxidative stress, which damages blood vessels and contributes to cardiovascular disease. The antioxidant-rich ingredients in Cardioton help neutralize free radicals and protect vascular health.

**4. Stress Reduction**
Chronic stress is a major contributor to hypertension. Adaptogenic herbs like Ashwagandha in Cardioton help the body manage stress response, indirectly supporting healthy BP levels.

**5. Cholesterol Management**
Several Cardioton ingredients have been shown to support healthy lipid profiles, helping maintain optimal cholesterol levels that contribute to overall heart health.

### Quality and Safety

Cardioton capsules are manufactured in GMP-certified facilities using high-quality, standardized herbal extracts. The formulation is free from synthetic chemicals, artificial additives, and harmful preservatives, making it suitable for long-term use as part of a heart-healthy lifestyle.

## Understanding Blood Pressure

### What is Blood Pressure?

Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood through your body. It's measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and recorded as two numbers:

- **Systolic Pressure (top number):** The pressure when your heart beats and pumps blood out
- **Diastolic Pressure (bottom number):** The pressure when your heart rests between beats

### Why Blood Pressure Matters

Healthy blood pressure is essential for proper organ function. When BP is too high (hypertension), it puts strain on your arteries, heart, and other organs. Over time, uncontrolled hypertension can lead to:

- Heart attack and heart failure
- Stroke
- Kidney disease
- Vision loss
- Cognitive decline

### Risk Factors for High Blood Pressure

**Modifiable Risk Factors:**
- Unhealthy diet (high sodium, low potassium)
- Physical inactivity
- Obesity
- Excessive alcohol consumption
- Tobacco use
- Chronic stress
- Poor sleep quality

**Non-Modifiable Risk Factors:**
- Family history of hypertension
- Age (risk increases with age)
- Ethnicity (higher risk in South Asian populations)
- Gender (men at higher risk until age 64)

### Prevention and Management

**Dietary Approaches:**
- Follow the DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)
- Reduce sodium to less than 2,300mg per day
- Increase potassium-rich foods (bananas, spinach, sweet potatoes)
- Limit processed and restaurant foods

**Physical Activity:**
- Aim for 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week
- Include strength training twice weekly
- Incorporate daily movement and reduce sitting time

**Stress Management:**
- Practice meditation or deep breathing
- Engage in hobbies and social activities
- Ensure adequate sleep (7-9 hours)
- Consider yoga or tai chi

### Monitoring Your BP

Regular monitoring is crucial for managing blood pressure:

- **Home Monitoring:** Check BP at the same time daily
- **Proper Technique:** Sit quietly for 5 minutes, arm at heart level
- **Record Keeping:** Track readings to identify patterns
- **Use Our Calculator:** Assess your risk category instantly
